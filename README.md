<h1>Prime Numbers (1-100)</h1>
  <p>This program is written in Java and aims to find and display the prime numbers between 1 and 100.</p>

  <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
  <p>To run this program, you need to have Java installed on your system.</p>

  <h2>How to Run</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Clone this repository or download the <code>Main.java</code> file.</li>
    <li>Open a command prompt or terminal.</li>
    <li>Navigate to the directory where the <code>Main.java</code> file is located.</li>
    <li>Compile the Java file by running the following command: <code>javac Main.java</code></li>
    <li>Run the program using the following command: <code>java Main</code></li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Program Description</h2>
  <p>The program uses a while loop to iterate through the numbers from 2 to 100. For each number, it checks if it is a prime number by iterating from 2 up to that number (exclusive) and checking if there is any divisor other than 1 and itself. If no divisor is found, the number is considered prime and printed on the console.</p>

  <h2>Sample Output</h2>
  <pre>
    Prime Numbers (1-100):
    2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 31 37 41 43 47 53 59 61 67 71 73 79 83 89 97
